# EaseMyTrip
I am planning for a vacation with my friends. I come across the ease-my-trip website for your flight bookings. I am fascinated by the how beautifully the backend systems work and try to replicate the ease-trip

I have build a SpringBoot Application easy-trip. Use hashmaps as Data Structure for the same.

Tried to follow the Spring architecture where build the controller layer, service layer and the repository layer which contains the HashMaps.
